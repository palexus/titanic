# titanic
This is a small kaggle challenge to study classification problems. Best kaggle score so far was 0.77751. When I have time I try to improve it.

# How to use it?

Clone this project and create a new environement, e.g.

 `conda create -n titanic -c conda-forge scikit-learn`.
 
 Then activate your new environment, here it is called webscraping and install the requirements.

`conda install jupyter`
 
 Then enjoy the solution in the jupyter notebook.
